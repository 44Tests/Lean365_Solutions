# Execution Plan for Reducing Oncology Referral Leakage (Lean365 Engagement)

## Project Objectives & Value Proposition

**Objective:** Significantly reduce oncology referral leakage in the client‚Äôs healthcare network. Referral leakage occurs when patients in need of oncology care are referred to providers outside the client‚Äôs network, resulting in lost revenue and fragmented patient care. Studies estimate that hospitals lose **10‚Äì30% of potential revenue** to referral leakage, equating to **\\$200‚Äì\\$500 million in annual losses**[\[1\]](https://clarifyhealth.com/insights/blog/unleashing-the-power-of-healthcare-analytics-data-to-improve-patient-loyalty-and-referrals/#:~:text=patients%20in%20their%20care%3B%20where,1). By keeping oncology referrals in-network, the client can improve care continuity, patient satisfaction, and financial performance.

**Value Proposition:** Our consulting engagement will leverage the **Lean365** continuous improvement platform to drive a systematic reduction in referral leakage. Lean365‚Äôs integrated tools (Balanced Scorecard, Huddle Boards, LeanFlow, PDCA, and Rounding) enable a *strategy-to-execution* approach that connects high-level goals to daily frontline actions. This ensures real-time performance tracking and rapid issue correction via AI-driven insights. The engagement will not only deliver measurable improvements in referral retention, but also build the client‚Äôs internal capability for ongoing **continuous improvement**. By the end of the project, the client will have an aligned strategy, streamlined referral processes, empowered staff, and a data-driven system to sustain results.

*The consulting team* consists of the Lead Consultant (a Lean process improvement expert with extensive internal healthcare experience) and a Data Scientist. Our methodology is grounded in **proven Lean practices** and will be executed with professional rigor and stakeholder engagement at every step.

## Scope and 6-Phase Approach

**Project Scope:** The focus is on the **end-to-end oncology referral process** ‚Äì from the point a referral is initiated (e.g. by a primary care physician or specialist) to the patient‚Äôs scheduled oncology appointment within the client‚Äôs network. We will examine referral workflows, scheduling, communication with referring providers, and any points where patients might leave the network. **In scope** are process changes, staff workflows, and supporting tools related to referral management. **Out of scope** are clinical treatment protocols or unrelated service lines. However, insights gained may inform broader referral management improvements beyond oncology.

**Approach:** The engagement will follow a structured **6-phase approach** (over \~6 months) aligning with Lean365‚Äôs diagnostic, implementation, and measurement stages. Each phase is outlined below, including objectives, activities, Lean365 tool utilization, and deliverables:

* **Phase 1: Kickoff & Diagnostic Assessment (Month 1\)** ‚Äì Launch the project, align on goals, and understand the current state of oncology referrals.

* **Phase 2: Data Analysis & Root Cause Identification (Month 1‚Äì2)** ‚Äì Quantify referral leakage and identify why and where it occurs.

* **Phase 3: Improvement Planning & Design (Month 2\)** ‚Äì Develop targeted solutions and future-state process designs to reduce leakage.

* **Phase 4: Implementation of Interventions (Months 3‚Äì4)** ‚Äì Execute the improvements (in two waves), supported by Lean365 tools, training, and change management.

* **Phase 5: Performance Monitoring & Adjustment (Month 5\)** ‚Äì Track results in real time, fine-tune processes through PDCA cycles, and coach the client team to take ownership.

* **Phase 6: Sustainment & Project Closure (Month 6\)** ‚Äì Ensure improvements are sustainable, hand over the Lean365 system to the client, and conclude the engagement with lasting capabilities.

## Timeline (6-Month Engagement Roadmap)

Below is a timeline of the engagement, broken out by month with major milestones and activities:

* **Month 1 ‚Äì Diagnostic & Kickoff:** Conduct project kickoff with executive sponsor and key stakeholders. Complete current-state assessment of the referral process through observations, staff interviews, and data extraction. Baseline metrics are established (e.g. current referral leakage rate and number of out-of-network referrals per month). By end of Month 1, deliver the project charter and a mapped current process, and begin initial data analysis.

* **Month 2 ‚Äì Analysis & Planning:** Dive into detailed data analysis (led by the Data Scientist) to quantify leakage and identify patterns (e.g. specific clinics or physicians with high external referrals). Hold a root cause analysis workshop using PDCA methodology to pinpoint why leakage occurs (for example, capacity constraints, patient preference, communication gaps). Develop a set of improvement ideas and design the future-state referral workflow. By end of Month 2, an **Improvement Plan** and future-state process design will be completed, along with a clear set of interventions to implement in the next phase.

* **Month 3 ‚Äì Implementation Launch:** Begin executing the highest-priority interventions. For instance, if analysis showed scheduling delays caused patients to go elsewhere, implement a new **referral scheduling protocol** or assign an oncology referral coordinator. Train staff on the new procedures (leveraging **LeanFlow** to distribute updated standard operating steps). **Deploy Lean365 Huddle Boards** for the referral management team ‚Äì each day, the team huddles to discuss any referral issues, track the status of referrals, and escalate obstacles. The consulting team closely supports this rollout, ensuring any immediate problems are addressed (rapid PDCA cycles). By the end of Month 3, initial changes are live and early feedback/metrics are collected.

* **Month 4 ‚Äì Full Intervention & Monitoring:** Continue implementation by rolling out remaining improvements (e.g., introduce a physician liaison program or automated referral tracking tool if those are in plan). **Leadership Rounding** starts this month: hospital leaders (e.g. Oncology director or CMO) regularly visit the referral team and oncology clinic to check in on the new processes, gather frontline feedback, and show support[\[5\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=5.%20%21,strategic%20alignment%20through%20regular%20touchpoints). The **Balanced Scorecard** is now active with real-time data, showing metrics such as the percentage of oncology referrals kept in-network, average time from referral to appointment, etc. Any metric deviations trigger immediate review. By the end of Month 4, all planned interventions should be in place. We expect to see early improvements (for example, a reduction in leakage rate from the baseline), which will be reviewed in a mid-engagement stakeholder update.

* **Month 5 ‚Äì Ongoing Monitoring & Adjustments:** With the new process in steady operation, the focus shifts to monitoring and fine-tuning. The consulting team monitors Balanced Scorecard dashboards daily/weekly for performance trends. **Daily huddles** continue under client team leadership (with consultant coaching as needed), ensuring issues are captured and small improvements are made continuously. We apply PDCA problem-solving for any emergent issues ‚Äì for instance, if certain referring physicians are still sending patients out-of-network, we develop targeted outreach or education as a countermeasure. The Data Scientist helps the client generate **monthly performance reports** to quantify progress (e.g. ‚Äúinternal referral retention improved from 70% to 85% in Month 5‚Äù). By the end of Month 5, the client‚Äôs team should be confidently managing the new referral process with less day-to-day intervention from the consultants.

* **Month 6 ‚Äì Sustainment & Project Close:** In the final month, we solidify the **sustainability measures**. A formal **Sustainment Plan** is delivered, outlining how the client will continue to monitor referral metrics and manage the process. This includes assigning process ownership (e.g. the Oncology department manager or a quality improvement leader will take ownership of the Balanced Scorecard and Huddle Board going forward). We ensure all process documentation in LeanFlow is updated and that staff know how to propose further improvements through that system. The consultant conducts a **knowledge transfer session** to the client‚Äôs team covering how to use Lean365 tools independently, interpret the dashboard, and run PDCA cycles without external help. Finally, a **project close-out meeting** is held with executive leadership to present the outcomes versus objectives: for example, the reduction in referral leakage (ideally meeting or exceeding target), the financial impact of retained referrals, and qualitative benefits such as improved patient navigation and staff engagement. We celebrate successes and outline any **next steps or opportunities** (e.g. expanding Lean365 improvements to other departments). The engagement formally concludes at the end of Month 6\.

## Roles and Responsibilities

A successful engagement requires close collaboration between the consulting team and client personnel. Below is an overview of key roles and their responsibilities:

| Role | Responsibilities |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Lead Consultant (Lean Expert)** ‚Äì *Consulting Firm* | \- Project manager and primary point of contact.\<br\>- Leads all phases of work, from diagnostic through sustainment.\<br\>- Facilitates workshops (process mapping, root cause, solution design).\<br\>- Coaches client leadership and staff in Lean365 practices.\<br\>- Ensures project deliverables are met on time and to quality. |
| **Data Scientist (Consultant)** ‚Äì *Consulting Firm* | \- Leads data collection, integration, and analysis of referral patterns.\<br\>- Develops the Balanced Scorecard metrics dashboard for referral leakage and related KPIs.\<br\>- Identifies trends, provides analytical insights (e.g. which physicians or locations have highest leakage).\<br\>- Assists in designing data-driven solutions (e.g. targeting specific referral sources).\<br\>- Helps train client analysts to maintain ongoing data tracking. |
| **Executive Sponsor** (e.g. COO or VP) ‚Äì *Client* | \- Provides project sponsorship and strategic alignment.\<br\>- Clears obstacles and ensures necessary resources (time, staff) are allocated to the project.\<br\>- Champions the initiative at the executive level, reinforcing its priority.\<br\>- Attends key update meetings (kickoff, mid-point, close-out) to validate progress and business impact. |
| **Project Champion/Lead** (e.g. Oncology Manager) ‚Äì *Client* | \- Day-to-day point person for the project on the client side.\<br\>- Coordinates with the consulting team on scheduling, data requests, and staff participation.\<br\>- Helps gather current state information and validates findings with frontline perspective.\<br\>- Co-leads implementation efforts, ensuring changes are operationalized in the department.\<br\>- Monitors internal team compliance with new processes and escalates issues. |
| **Frontline Staff & Managers** ‚Äì *Client* | \- Participate in interviews, workshops, and training sessions.\<br\>- Provide insights into current referral workflow and pain points.\<br\>- Embrace new processes (e.g. use Huddle Boards daily, follow new referral protocols).\<br\>- Generate improvement ideas during huddles and engage in PDCA problem-solving for their work area.\<br\>- Serve as ‚Äúchange agents‚Äù by giving feedback and encouraging peers during the change. |
| **Steering Committee** (optional) ‚Äì *Client & Consultant* | \- A small group of senior stakeholders (e.g. Oncology director, IT lead, Finance rep) and the consulting lead.\<br\>- Meets monthly to review project status, metric outcomes, and approve any scope changes or major decisions.\<br\>- Helps ensure cross-functional support (for example, if IT system changes are needed for referral tracking, the IT lead on this committee facilitates that).\<br\>- Assists in removing barriers and sustaining executive buy-in throughout the engagement. |

**Client Resource Requirements:** We emphasize *collaboration over large budgets*. The client should expect to dedicate **time and talent** rather than a direct financial outlay for consulting fees (since budget wasn‚Äôt specified). Key resource needs include:

* **Time Commitment:** Project Champion at \~20-30% of their time for 6 months; involvement of frontline staff in brief daily huddles (10-15 minutes each day) and periodic workshops (a few half-day sessions in Month 1-2). Leadership should allocate at least 2 hours per week for sponsor/champion check-ins and to conduct rounding interactions with staff during implementation.

* **Data Access & IT Support:** Access to relevant data systems (e.g. referral databases, scheduling systems, EHR) for the data analysis is crucial. An IT analyst may need to spend a few hours assisting the Data Scientist with data pulls and integration into the Lean365 Balanced Scorecard.

* **Participation in Training:** All staff involved in the referral process (oncology schedulers, nurse navigators, call center reps, etc.) will need to attend training on the new process and Lean365 tools (estimated 1-2 sessions of 1 hour each in Month 3).

* **Continuous Engagement:** Client leadership must remain visibly engaged ‚Äì e.g. joining some daily huddles occasionally, addressing issues quickly, and celebrating improvements. This ensures momentum and signals organizational commitment (a **critical success factor** for change initiatives).

By planning for these resource needs up front, we set realistic expectations and prevent resource constraints from hindering the project‚Äôs progress. The engagement plan assumes full support in these areas; if any resource is unavailable, timeline adjustments or scope refinements may be necessary (to be addressed via the Steering Committee).

## Key Deliverables by Phase

For clarity, the major deliverables in each phase are highlighted below (some were noted earlier):

* **Phase 1 (Diagnostic):** Project Charter & Scope Document; Current State Process Map (visual of the referral process); Baseline Metrics Report (e.g. current leakage rate, volumes); Stakeholder Analysis (identifying key parties and their roles in referrals).

* **Phase 2 (Analysis):** Referral Leakage Diagnostic Report (quantitative findings and qualitative insights on root causes); Prioritized Problem/Opportunity List with impact estimates; Initial Balanced Scorecard setup with baseline values for each metric (ready for tracking improvements).

* **Phase 3 (Design):** Future State Process Map (illustrating the improved referral workflow with reduced leakage points); Detailed Implementation Roadmap (Gantt chart or action plan of who will do what, and when, over Months 3‚Äì6); Communication Plan (how changes will be communicated to staff and referring providers); Training Plan and Materials (for onboarding staff to new process and Lean365 tools).

* **Phase 4 (Implementation):** Change Implementation Log (record of all interventions executed, e.g. ‚ÄúReferral coordinator role established and filled on \[date\]‚Äù); Training Completion Report (which staff trained, when); Lean365 Tools Usage Report (confirmation that Balanced Scorecard dashboard is live, Huddle Board and Rounding modules deployed and in use); Mid-Project Review Presentation (at end of Month 4, summarizing what has been implemented and early results achieved).

* **Phase 5 (Monitoring):** Monthly Performance Reports (tracking key metrics like referral retention %, time to appointment, patient feedback, etc., compared to baseline and targets); PDCA Cycle Documentation (brief reports on any iterative fixes or tweaks made during the monitoring phase); Continuous Improvement Idea Log (ideas generated by staff in huddles for further improvements, to show engagement level); Coaching/Capability Assessment (evaluation of how well the client team can independently run the process and Lean365 tools at this point).

* **Phase 6 (Sustainment & Closure):** **Sustainability Plan** (document outlining governance, e.g. who will review the Balanced Scorecard weekly, how often to continue huddles and rounding after project, and a ‚Äútrigger plan‚Äù for responding if metrics slip in the future); Updated Standard Operating Procedures (finalized documents in LeanFlow reflecting the new referral process and any related policy changes); Final Outcomes Report (comprehensive report detailing objectives vs. results, such as "% reduction in leakage, \\$ revenue retained, other benefits, lessons learned"); and a Project Closure Presentation delivered to the executive team with recommendations and an action plan for maintaining improvements. All Lean365 tools remain with the client for ongoing use, and a final knowledge transfer is completed.

## Integration of Lean365 Tools

Throughout this engagement, the **Lean365 platform** is central to driving change and ensuring sustainability. Each tool will be utilized as follows:

* **Balanced Scorecard:** Used to translate the project‚Äôs strategic goal (reducing referral leakage) into specific, measurable KPIs at all relevant levels. We will set up a Balanced Scorecard module focusing on metrics like *referral retention rate*, *time from referral to oncology consult*, and *patient keepage rate*. The Balanced Scorecard provides **real-time performance visibility**, with data integrations and color-coded indicators so the team can immediately see the impact of improvements or the emergence of any performance gaps. This ensures that we can rapidly identify if an intervention is not working and correct course. It also creates transparency and accountability: as metrics improve, everyone can see the progress, reinforcing the connection between daily work and strategic goals.

* **Huddle Board:** Implemented at the start of the implementation phase (Phase 4\) to establish daily continuous improvement habits among the frontline team. The Huddle Board module in Lean365 enables teams to **document daily improvements and share successful interventions** across the organization[\[8\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=Enables%20frontline%20teams%20to%20document,improvement%20aligned%20with%20strategic%20objectives). In practice, each morning the referral coordination team (and potentially the oncology clinic staff) will hold a brief stand-up meeting at the Huddle Board (digital or physical) to review yesterday‚Äôs results (e.g. ‚Äú5 new referrals came in, 1 went out-of-network ‚Äì why?‚Äù) and identify any quick actions for today. Issues that can‚Äôt be resolved immediately in the huddle are escalated (e.g. flagged for a PDCA project). This habit creates a **culture of continuous improvement aligned with strategic objectives**[\[8\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=Enables%20frontline%20teams%20to%20document,improvement%20aligned%20with%20strategic%20objectives) ‚Äì staff are engaged daily in finding ways to keep referrals internal and improve patient experience.

* **LeanFlow:** Employed from the diagnostic phase onward as the repository for process documentation. LeanFlow ensures **current, accessible standard operating procedures** are maintained. We will document the **current state** referral process in LeanFlow during Phase 1, which helps in identifying inefficiencies and variations in how referrals are handled. As we design the future state (Phase 3), those new process steps are also documented in LeanFlow and updated in real-time as changes roll out. Frontline staff will have mobile-first access to these standard procedures, ensuring consistency in the new referral workflow and making it easier to train new staff. LeanFlow also empowers employees to suggest improvements to the documented processes[\[7\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=3.%20%21,while%20empowering%20frontline%20improvement%20suggestions), so as the referral process evolves, staff can continuously contribute to keeping documentation and practice aligned.

* **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Cycle:** Used as the core problem-solving and improvement methodology in the engagement. At Phase 2, we use PDCA thinking to plan interventions based on root causes (Plan). During implementation (Phase 4), each major change can be run as a mini PDCA cycle ‚Äì for example, *Plan:* implement a new referral form; *Do:* pilot it for two weeks; *Check:* measure if internal referral completion improved; *Act:* adjust the form or roll it out fully. The Lean365 PDCA module provides a **structured problem-solving approach** with AI insights from past projects to speed up learning. This will **compress our improvement cycles and accelerate implementation**, as the team can avoid ‚Äúreinventing the wheel‚Äù and quickly adopt what works. Throughout Phase 5, any new issues identified will go through PDCA ‚Äì ensuring that improvements are data-driven and systematically tested before full adoption.

* **Rounding:** Starting in Phase 4 and continuing through Phase 6, the Rounding module is utilized to formalize leadership‚Äôs role in the improvement process. Lean365 Rounding **digitalizes leadership engagement** by guiding leaders to have regular, structured interactions with frontline staff. For this project, leaders (such as the Oncology Service Line Director or clinic manager) will conduct purposeful rounding, e.g. weekly walks to the referral office or huddle, to ask specific questions: ‚ÄúWhat barriers are you encountering in keeping referrals in-network this week?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you have the resources to follow up with all referrals?‚Äù The Rounding tool will **capture feedback and remove barriers in real-time** ‚Äì for instance, if staff say they lack a certain information from referring physicians, the leader notes it and takes action that day. It also helps sustain **strategic alignment** by keeping leaders connected to front-line execution of the referral strategy. Data from rounding (common issues, suggestions, recognition of good performance) will be reported and fed back into our project meetings. This closes the loop between strategy and daily operations and helps maintain momentum and morale.

By integrating these Lean365 tools into the engagement, we ensure that improvements are not one-off events but part of a **‚ÄúDaily Practice Engine‚Äù** that will continue beyond the project[\[10\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=Structured%20Projects%20,cycles%20and%20reduce%20implementation%20time)[\[11\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=,Rounding). The Balanced Scorecard aligns everyone on the goal, Huddle Boards and PDCA drive daily and weekly improvements, LeanFlow keeps processes standardized, and Rounding ensures leaders continuously support and align with the teams. This integrated approach mirrors how top consulting firms drive sustainable change ‚Äì combining technical solutions with cultural change elements.

## Monitoring & Sustainability Plan

Monitoring results and building sustainability are embedded in our approach, particularly in Phases 5 and 6:

**Performance Monitoring:** We will monitor key performance indicators *throughout* the project, not just at the end. The Balanced Scorecard, as noted, allows for **live tracking of referral metrics**[\[9\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=Transforms%20strategic%20goals%20into%20measurable,and%20correction%20of%20performance%20gaps). We will establish a cadence of reviews: for example, weekly internal team reviews of the dashboard and monthly formal reviews with the executive sponsor. During the 3-month monitoring phase, any negative trends or shortfalls against targets will trigger an immediate response (e.g. initiate a PDCA cycle to investigate and address). By the end of the engagement, the client will have a fully functioning **performance monitoring system** that can be embedded into routine management meetings. The **Balanced Scorecard module** remains as a central tool for sustaining visibility of referral metrics long-term.

**Sustainability Steps:** Our execution plan explicitly focuses on creating **self-sustaining momentum**[\[12\]](file://file-5K6yStXHjBK73Rnd5zwaun#:~:text=4.%20Create%20Self,refine%20processes%20without%20external%20intervention) within the client organization. Key steps include:

* **Empowering a Process Owner:** We will identify and coach a specific client staff member (or team) to become the ‚Äúreferral process owner‚Äù moving forward. This person will take over the maintenance of the Balanced Scorecard and LeanFlow documentation, facilitate the daily huddles after project end, and lead ongoing PDCA efforts. By shadowing the consultants during the project and gradually taking the lead in Month 5, this owner gains the capability and confidence to continue the work.

* **Establishing a Governance Routine:** The sustainability plan will recommend a governance structure such as a **monthly performance review** (e.g. the Oncology Manager reports referral metrics and improvement actions to the senior leadership). We‚Äôll also encourage that the **Steering Committee** (or at least the executive sponsor and process owner) continues to meet quarterly post-project to oversee sustained progress and tackle any escalated issues.

* **Standard Work & Documentation:** All new processes will be documented as **standard work** (SOPs) in LeanFlow and hard copies if needed. We will train staff on the importance of adhering to these standards and also updating them when improvements are made. This ensures that the process changes stick and do not regress over time. LeanFlow‚Äôs ease of updating SOPs means the client can keep processes current with minimal effort.

* **Continued Huddles and Rounding:** A major aim is to instill the habit of daily huddles for continuous improvement. We will leave behind a **Huddle Board** that the team owns, so they can keep the practice going indefinitely. Similarly, we will encourage leadership to continue rounding beyond the project‚Äôs end (e.g. the executive sponsor might commit to attend one huddle a month even after project close, as a sign of ongoing support). This consistent leadership engagement is crucial for sustaining a culture of improvement and will be outlined in the sustainability plan.

* **Monitoring for Backslide:** The plan will include triggers or alerts (often via the Balanced Scorecard) to catch if referral leakage starts creeping up again. For example, if the referral retention rate falls below a certain threshold in a future quarter, the process owner should convene a PDCA team to diagnose and fix the issue. Essentially, the tools and routines we implement act as a **control system** to hold the gains.

* **Training and Knowledge Transfer:** By project end, multiple client team members will be trained in Lean365 tools and Lean problem-solving. We will provide ‚Äútrain-the-trainer‚Äù sessions so that knowledge is institutionalized. For instance, the client‚Äôs quality improvement department could be involved so they can replicate this approach for other processes. We will also leave behind all training materials and access to Lean365 support resources.

**Sustainability Metrics:** As part of the Balanced Scorecard, we will define not just outcome metrics but process metrics that indicate whether the new routines are happening. For example, *huddle participation rate* or *number of improvement ideas submitted by staff* can be tracked. These serve as early warning indicators of engagement. If those remain high, it‚Äôs likely the improvements will last; if they drop, leadership can intervene to reinforce the importance of the new practices.

In summary, the monitoring and sustainability steps are designed to ensure that the reduced referral leakage is **not a one-time dip**, but a permanent improvement. By embedding Lean365 capabilities into the client‚Äôs daily operations, the organization should continue to improve beyond our engagement, creating a lasting return on investment.

## Assumptions and Client Requirements

Finally, this execution plan is built on several **key assumptions** and requires certain **commitments from the client** to be successful:

* **Leadership Support Assumed:** We assume strong and consistent support from the client‚Äôs leadership (executives and department heads) throughout the project. This includes alignment on the importance of reducing referral leakage and willingness to champion changes. Lack of visible leadership commitment is a known failure factor for transformations, so it‚Äôs critical that leaders remain engaged (e.g. attending kickoffs, reviewing scorecards, doing rounding) all 6 months. If leadership were to change priorities mid-project, the timeline or scope might need adjustment.

* **Data Availability:** We assume the client can provide the necessary data on referrals (e.g. number of referrals, how many went out-of-network, reasons if known, etc.) in a timely manner. If data quality issues arise (fragmented systems, missing data), the Data Scientist will work with client IT to address them, but significant data unavailability could impact the diagnostic phase timeline. We also assume permission to integrate data into Lean365‚Äôs Balanced Scorecard (which can be done securely; any IT/security requirements will be discussed at kickoff).

* **Client Resource Time:** As outlined, we require the client to allocate the Project Champion and allow frontline staff time to participate. We assume that during implementation, staff can take the small amount of time needed for daily huddles and that their managers will accommodate this as part of work (not seeing it as extra duty but as part of the job). If certain key individuals are unavailable (due to turnover or other projects), we will need equivalent replacements to maintain project momentum.

* **No Major Scope Change:** This plan assumes the project scope remains focused on oncology referral leakage. If mid-project the client decides to expand scope (e.g. to include all specialty referrals or other service lines), we would need to re-plan phases and timeline accordingly (likely needing additional time or resources). Similarly, we assume no unexpected organizational disruptions (like a merger or major policy change in the 6-month window) that would pull attention away from this project.

* **Lean365 Platform Access:** We assume the client will either have the Lean365 platform available (license/access) or agree to implement it as part of the engagement. The proposal is built around using these tools; if not, we‚Äôd substitute with manual or other tools but that could reduce efficiency. The value proposition of AI-driven insights and integrated modules relies on Lean365 ‚Äì we have accounted for training the client on these modules. If the client‚Äôs policy requires additional approvals to use such a platform, those should be secured upfront.

* **Client Culture Openness:** We assume an open mindset among the client‚Äôs staff ‚Äì i.e., willingness to change processes and try Lean methods. Given the consultant‚Äôs internal experience, we know change fatigue or resistance can occur. If we encounter resistance, part of our approach (with leadership help) will be change management and communication. We have built-in cultural reinforcement via rounding and communication plans. But if the culture is highly change-averse, progress might be slower; we would incorporate more change management activities as needed.

In terms of **budget**: Since the client did not set a budget, we have focused on resource needs instead. We assume the client will provide normal operational resources (meeting space, internal personnel time, etc.) at no extra cost. Any potential expenditures (e.g. maybe investing in a referral tracking software or marketing to referring physicians) will be presented as recommendations with a business case, but it‚Äôs understood the consultant will not incur costs on the client‚Äôs behalf without approval. Essentially, the engagement is structured to use **existing resources more effectively** ‚Äì a Lean principle ‚Äì rather than large new investments.

**Assumption Validation:** These assumptions will be verified during the **Kickoff phase (Phase 1\)**. The Project Charter will explicitly list them and both the consulting team and client sponsor will agree on them. If any assumption is found to be invalid, we will jointly develop a risk mitigation plan or adjust the execution plan accordingly (for example, if data is very poor, perhaps spend extra time in Phase 1 on data cleanup, or if staff are limited, maybe extend the timeline slightly to not overburden them).

---

**In Conclusion,** this execution plan provides a comprehensive roadmap to reduce oncology referral leakage using a Lean365-enabled approach. It balances rigorous analysis, practical implementation steps, and sustainability mechanisms in a way that a top-tier consulting firm would operate. By following this 6-phase plan, we aim to achieve a substantial reduction in referral leakage (improving internal referral retention and revenue capture), while empowering the client‚Äôs team with the tools and habits for continuous improvement. The success of this engagement will be measured not just by short-term metrics improvements, but by the lasting capability we build ‚Äì ensuring the client can continue to refine and optimize their referral processes well into the future.
