**LeanFlow: Simplify, Standardize, and Strengthen Your Processes**  
Stop losing time and consistency to outdated binders, spreadsheets, and scattered photos. LeanFlow transforms process documentation and improvement into a mobile-first, frontline-driven experience—always current, always compliant.

**The Problem**

Organizations still rely on notepads, photos, Excel files, or tribal knowledge.

* Procedures are outdated the moment they’re shared.  
* Training is inconsistent and hard to track.  
* Frontline improvements get lost in meetings or emails.  
* Routing for operations is scattered across files and whiteboards.  
* Audit prep requires painful, manual updates.

The result: inefficiency, rework, compliance risk, and frustration.

**The Solution: LeanFlow**

A modern, mobile solution that makes processes **easy to capture, update, and continuously improve**—directly at the frontline.

* **Effortless Documentation** – Capture and update workflows instantly from any device.  
* **Collaborative Improvements** – Empower frontline staff to suggest better ways in the moment—no waiting for meetings or approvals.  
* **Always Current & Audit-Ready** – QR codes ensure every team member sees the latest “current best way.” Stay aligned with ISO, OSHA, FDA, and other standards automatically, so audits become a formality, not a fire drill.  
* **Targeted Training** – Build role-based training modules, assign them to new or existing staff, and track completion with ease.  
* **Smart Routing** – Define and share the exact sequence of operations, including work centers, machines, tools, and estimated times—so everyone follows the same playbook.
