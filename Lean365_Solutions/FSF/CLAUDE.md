# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Flow-State Framework (FSF)** documentation and presentation materials for Lean365, a comprehensive strategy execution platform. The FSF addresses the critical gap between strategic planning and successful execution, providing a systematic approach to transform strategic intent into instinctive organizational action.

### Key Components

The repository is structured as a presentation and documentation project focused on:

- **Flow-State Framework**: A 4-stage methodology (Assessment, Strategic Cascade, Daily Practice, Leadership Engagement) that builds organizational muscle memory for strategic execution
- **Lean365 Platform**: 5 integrated modules (Balanced Scorecard, Huddle Board, LeanFlow, PDCA, Rounding) that enable the framework
- **Presentation Materials**: Complete HTML-based slide presentation with navigation and interactive features
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown files covering each module and the overall framework

## Content Guidelines

This is a business strategy and organizational transformation framework - all content should maintain a professional, consultative tone focused on helping organizations bridge the strategy-execution gap.

### Key Concepts to Understand

- **Strategy-Execution Crisis**: 67% of strategies fail due to execution challenges, not strategy design
- **Flow-State Framework**: Creates organizational "muscle memory" where strategic thinking becomes automatic
- **Daily Practice Engine**: The core mechanism that transforms strategic intent into instinctive action through repeated, structured daily activities
- **Integrated Platform Approach**: Unlike traditional point solutions, Lean365 provides a cohesive ecosystem where all modules share data and reinforce strategic behaviors

### Framework Methodology

1. **Assessment Phase (Days 1-30)**: Cultural readiness and operational maturity evaluation
2. **Strategic Cascade Phase (Days 31-60)**: Creating clear line-of-sight from strategy to frontline work
3. **Daily Practice Engine (Days 61-90)**: Building strategic muscle memory through structured daily activities
4. **Leadership Engagement**: Sustained momentum through systematic leader involvement

## Working with This Repository

### Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation and presentation repository without build processes:

- **View Presentation**: Open `FSF Presentation/lean365_presentation.html` in a browser
- **Edit Content**: Modify markdown files in the `docs/` folder
- **Update Presentation**: Edit the HTML file directly (inline CSS/JS structure)

### Development Commands

This repository contains static content only:
- No build process required
- No package manager (npm/yarn) setup
- No testing framework
- Open HTML files directly in browser for preview

### Architecture Overview

The repository follows a simple static documentation structure:
- **Single HTML Presentation**: Self-contained file with embedded CSS/JS (no external dependencies)
- **Markdown Documentation**: Standalone files in `/docs` folder, each covering one Lean365 module
- **Static Assets**: SVG icons and images in `/images` folder
- **No Build Pipeline**: Direct file editing and browser preview workflow

### Documentation Standards

- Maintain consistent messaging about the 67% strategy failure rate and 3x higher success rate claims
- Keep focus on transforming "strategic intent into instinctive action"
- Emphasize the difference between compliance-focused vs. competence-building approaches
- Reference the 4-stage Flow-State Framework methodology consistently

### Presentation Features

The HTML presentation includes:
- 7 slides with navigation controls
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, spacebar)
- Fullscreen capability
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Embedded styling and JavaScript

When editing presentation content, maintain the visual hierarchy and professional styling established in the existing design.
