## Overview: Addressing Oncology Referral Leakage

### **1\. Challenge Context**

We recognize your oncology practice is facing **referral leakage** issues, which significantly impacts patient continuity and network revenue.

\- Approximately **55–65%** of referrals occur outside the provider network, resulting in average losses of **$821K–$971K per physician annually**, and up to **$150B per year** industry-wide.  
\- In some systems, just 35–40% of specialty referrals result in completed appointments.

Addressing referral leakage improves care coordination, enhances patient satisfaction, and drives financial retention.
